!import-table-item --dmg-potion-miscibility --Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. A potion has no effect if it can’t be halved in this way. --10 --
!import-table-item --dmg-potion-miscibility --Both potions work normally. --55 --
!import-table-item --dmg-potion-miscibility --The numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally. --9 --
!import-table-item --dmg-potion-miscibility --Only one potion works, but its effect is permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent, or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a potion of healing might increase the drinker’s hit point maximum by 4, or oil of etherealness might permanently trap the user in the Ethereal Plane. At your discretion, an appropriate spell, such as dispel magic or remove curse, might end this lasting effect. --1 --
